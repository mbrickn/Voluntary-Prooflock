# Voluntary Prooflock

Old code for my Kent Hack Enough 2014 Nintendo DS project.

This application was acomplished with just 4 lines of SMILE basic.

Since the Nintendo 3DS doesn't support multitasking with legacy DSi software, the program must be exited and state lost to use the console for anything else.

This encourages the user to modify the code to cheat, making it a useful educational tool.
